  This is a Windows port of a now-cancelled mobile project of mine. It was meant to be an app that a user could use to quickly and effeciently track their spending,
by entering "Expenses", which would be stored in a local SQL database. The app would allow the user to categorize expenses based on various user-made categories,
view and sort their expenses by category or amount, and analyze their spending over a period of a week/month/year and get a detailed breakdown of the amount they spent
on different things, as well as the approximate amount they spent per day/week/month.
